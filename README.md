- 👋 Hi, I’m @ArchGryphon9362
- 👀 I’m interested in programming. My favourite coding languge is `node(js);`
- 🌱 I’m currently learning basically everything. At this point in time I'm trying to learn new things every day.
- 💞️ I’m currently working on a bot called [YAVAB](https://github.com/ArchGryphon9362/YAVAB) for my uncle's Discord Server for his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFzZmf27xo3W7nvBm7EuKBg) which you should check out :)
- 📫 If you want to reach out to me, best place would be Discord as I'm most active there. My username is `ArchGryphon9362#6132`. My DM's are always open for anybody who wants to contact me, just don't forget to friend me because we're probably not in a mutual server 😅.

<!--
Psst, this if you're here, you might also want to know that I am currently working on reverse engineering the Tesla BLE connection, and it seems that progress is going well and I might have a proof-of-concept some time soon 😅, reach out to me on Discord if you wanna know more :)
