- 👋 Hi, I’m @ArchGryphon9362
- 👀 I’m interested in programming. My favourite coding languges is `node(js);`
- 🌱 I’m currently learning basically everything. At this point in time I'm trying and learning new things every day.
- 💞️ I’m currently working on a bot called YAVAB for my uncle's Discord Server for his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFzZmf27xo3W7nvBm7EuKBg) which you should check out :)
- 📫 If you want to reach out to me, best place would be Discord as I'm most active there. My username is `ArchGryphon9362#6132`. My DM's are always open for anybody who wants to contact me, just don't forget to friend me because we're probably not in a mutual server 😅.
