- 👋 Hi, I’m @ArchGryphon9362
- 👀 I’m interested in programming. My favourite coding languge is `node(js);`
- 🌱 I’m currently learning basically everything. At this point in time I'm trying to learn new things every day.
- 💞️ I’m currently working on a bot called [YAVAB](https://github.com/ArchGryphon9362/YAVAB) for my uncle's Discord Server for his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFzZmf27xo3W7nvBm7EuKBg) which you should check out :)
- 📫 If you want to reach out to me, best place would be Discord as I'm most active there. My username is `ArchGryphon9362#6132`. My DM's are always open for anybody who wants to contact me, just don't forget to friend me because we're probably not in a mutual server 😅.

✨ The Secrets ✨

If you're here, you might also want to know that I am currently working on reverse engineering the Tesla BLE connection, and it seems that progress is going well and I might have a proof-of-concept some time soon 😅, reach out to me on Discord if you wanna know more ( P.S. don't tell anybody you found this, if they want to find it, they'll find it, oh and just an fyi to surprise you a bit, I'm 14 🙂 ).

Haha, so basically things have turned around and now I'm in the process of reverse engineering the app to find out about the BLE connection, but things are going great. I have a private repo here on GH and a public repo on my self hosted Gitea server which you can check out at https://git.kosmox.ml/ArchGryphon9362/TeslaBLE. Keep up to date with the commit messages, and my main edits are currently switching over to the "protobufDiscoveryAttempt" directory. I am really confident that I'm gonna finish this in less than a month and a half... 2 months at most. Anyways, this is a really cool project for me, so gl me :)
